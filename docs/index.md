* [Java \| Selenium \| TestNG](frameworks/java-selenium-testng)

### Introduction
Want to start automating your tests but you don't know where to start? Have you implemented many projects before but you just don't like to spend those first few days getting everything up and running? Are you unsure of how you should structure your project? I'm hoping to make these all questions of the past! I have been working with testautomation for several years now and have started from scratch many times over. With this repository I'm hoping to save other people the effort of doing this, and to help them and myself with some nice tutorials.

### Project quality
I strive to meet the highest quality possible but each project of course has its own requirements. The projects in this repository will aim to meet the following requirements:

#### Code
* All example code will have comments explaining their purpose
* Example code builds without errors
* Code is written according to normal coding standards

#### Execution
* Projects will execute both in command line using the build tool or in the IDE
* Example code will execute without errors
* All projects will run on multiple browsers with one command

#### Reporting
* Reports are automatically generated
* Reports clearly show results per browser
